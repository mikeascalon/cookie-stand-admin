Author: Michelangelo Ascalon

## Overview

This project aims to create a Cookie Stand Admin application using Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It showcases the integration of React with Next.js for server-side rendering and the utility-first styling approach of Tailwind CSS. This application allows users to manage cookie stand locations, including adding new stands and viewing data on existing ones.

### Installation

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```
   cd cookie-stand-admin
   ```
3. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Run the development server
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```
   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


## Usage

The application is straightforward to use. Navigate through the application to manage cookie stands:

- **Create Cookie Stand**: Fill out the form in the main section to add a new cookie stand. Input fields include location, minimum customers per hour, maximum customers per hour, and average cookies per sale.
- **View Cookie Stands**: The table below the form displays all added cookie stands along with their details.
